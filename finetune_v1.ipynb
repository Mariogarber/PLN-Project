    "\n",
    "## 🔧 **How It Works**\n",
    "\n",
    "The custom loss function works by:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Computing original loss** - Standard cross-entropy loss from the model\n",
    "2. **Decoding predictions** - Convert model logits to text during training\n",
    "3. **Detecting forbidden words** - Scan generated text for banned words using regex\n",
    "4. **Adding penalty** - Add `penalty_weight × forbidden_word_count` to the loss\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📊 **Mathematical Formula**\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Total Loss = Original Loss + (penalty_weight × Σ forbidden_words_found)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "- Original loss: `2.45`\n",
    "- Forbidden words found: `2` (e.g., \"stupid\", \"hate\")\n",
    "- Penalty weight: `2.0`\n",
    "- **Total loss: `2.45 + (2.0 × 2) = 6.45`**\n",

    "## 🎛️ **Configuration Options**\n",

    "    forbidden_words=[\"hate\", \"stupid\", \"toxic\", \"bad\"],\n",
    "    penalty_weight=1.5,  # Moderate penalty\n",
    "    # ... other trainer arguments\n",
    ")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Aggressive Penalty (Stronger Deterrent)**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "AGGRESSIVE_WORDS = [\"hate\", \"kill\", \"die\", \"stupid\", \"idiot\", \"worthless\"]\n",
    "aggressive_trainer = CustomLossTrainer(\n",
    "    forbidden_words=AGGRESSIVE_WORDS,\n",
    "    penalty_weight=5.0,  # High penalty\n",

    "### **Adaptive Penalty (Increases Over Time)**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "adaptive_trainer = AdaptiveLossTrainer(\n",
    "    penalty_start=0.5,   # Start with low penalty\n",
    "    penalty_end=3.0,     # End with high penalty\n",

    "|----------------|--------|----------|\n",
    "| `0.1 - 0.5` | Gentle nudge | Fine-tuning already good models |\n",

    "## 🧪 **Testing & Validation**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Step 1: Test the Function**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Test if custom loss is working\n",
    "regular_loss, custom_loss = test_custom_loss_function()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Step 2: Analyze Dataset**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Check forbidden words in your data\n",
    "toxic_count, neutral_count = analyze_forbidden_words_in_dataset()\n",
    "```\n",

    "The trainer will log every 50 steps:\n",

    "## 🎯 **Best Practices**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **1. Start Conservative**\n",
    "- Begin with `penalty_weight=1.0`\n",
    "- Monitor training stability\n",
    "- Increase gradually if needed\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2. Balance is Key**\n",
    "- Too high penalty → Model may avoid generating anything\n",
    "- Too low penalty → Ineffective deterrent\n",
    "- **Sweet spot: 1.0-2.0 for most cases**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **3. Customize Forbidden Words**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Domain-specific forbidden words\n",
    "MEDICAL_FORBIDDEN = [\"kill\", \"die\", \"harm\", \"dangerous\", \"toxic\"]\n",
    "SOCIAL_FORBIDDEN = [\"hate\", \"stupid\", \"worthless\", \"loser\", \"pathetic\"]\n",
    "\n",
    "# Combine lists\n",
    "CUSTOM_FORBIDDEN = MEDICAL_FORBIDDEN + SOCIAL_FORBIDDEN\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### **4. Monitor Training**\n",
    "- Watch for loss spikes (penalty too high)\n",
    "- Check generated samples during training\n",
    "- Validate on test set regularly\n",
